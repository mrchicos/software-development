# Insert intervals
- https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/
- **Very Interesting/Frustrating**Using a while loop is much simplier than using for loop in this case
    - While loop is based on a condition
    - For loop focus on the index position, then one has to iterate all the conditions and considering the boundary position. 
- Decide whether sort by end or beginning of the intervals
